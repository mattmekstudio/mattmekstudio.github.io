    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
    I am a mixed-media artist working through drawing, collage, photography, and material-based processes. My practice centers on plants, place, and recording, using collage thinking to bring together drawing, photography, and material processes. Plants appear in my work as subjects, materials, and quiet records of everyday environments.
      
My current practice moves fluidly between pen drawing, watercolor, gouache, photography, cyanotype, and collage. I work with found and leftover materials—including paper, cardboard, dried plants, plastic, bark, and yarn—cutting, assembling, and weaving them into layered compositions. Collage functions as both a technique and a way of thinking, allowing fragments from different processes to coexist within a single work.
      
Observation and recording are central to how I work. Drawing, photographing, pressing plants, and making cyanotypes operate as parallel methods of registering time, light, and place. These recorded elements are later translated into collage or woven structures, allowing the material’s original character to remain.
      
My work emphasizes slowness, repetition, and attention to material qualities. Through assembling and reconfiguring fragments, I explore relationships between natural forms, human intervention, and the environments I inhabit, creating works that sit between documentation and abstraction.
